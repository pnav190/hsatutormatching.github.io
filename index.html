    bio: "Ben is an American living abroad in Germany and is a student at Harvard College, studying Math, Statistics, and German. He has been interested in math since the 8th grade, when he earned a perfect score of 5 on the AP Calculus BC exam. In high school, Ben kept up his journey into math by scoring an 800 on the SAT math section and taking nearly every math course available to him, from Calculus III and Linear Algebra to Complex Analysis. He also stayed busy with extracurriculars, especially through tutoring as Math Honor Society president and founding/overseeing his school's study hall tutoring period that served 200+ students, which gave him extensive background in math tutoring.  However, Ben is also well-versed in the college application process. His primary expertise in applications is the essay section, both through the Common App and supplemental essays, by crafting a narrative based on what an applicant's profile looks like. His own essays helped him gain admission to Harvard, Stanford, and Dartmouth. He also is suited to mentor AP and SAT English, scoring 750 on the SAT reading section and 5s in both AP English Language and Literature. He currently writes News and Op-Eds for the Harvard Independent newspaper on campus, and enjoys the process of curating stories through writing.",
